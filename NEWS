* Major changes in Gnuk 0.5

  Released 2010-12-XX, by NIIBE Yutaka

** LED blink
LED blink now shows status output the card.  It shows the status of
CHV3, CHV2, and CHV1 when GPG is accessing the card.

** New board support "STM8S Discovery"
ST-Link part (with STM32F103C8T6) of STM8S Discovery board is now supported.

** Digital signing for SHA224/SHA256/SHA384/SHA512 digestInfo is now possible.

** Fixes for password management
Now, you can allow card to do digital signing multiple times with
single authentication.  You can use "forcesig" subcommand in card-edit
of GnuPG to enable the feature.

** Key management changes
If you remove all keys, it is possible to import keys again.

** More improved USB-CCID/ICCD implementation.
Gnuk works better with GPG's in-stock protocol stack.  You can do
digital signing (not decryption, key import, or get_public_key in
GPG2).  For decryption, key import and get_public_key, changes are
needed for GPG (scd/ccid-driver.c) to support the case of extended
APDU.  In short, you can sign with Gnuk by GPG 1.
