* Random Number Generator

RNG is needed for Data Encryption Key to encrypt private key (P and Q).
It is important to collect enough entropy.  Perhaps, it would
be possible to get entropy from USB traffic (of other devices).


* RSA

It would be good not to use malloc.


* Manufacture ID

Get it from FSFE.


* Serial number

Currently, aid[] in openpgp-do.c has serial number 00000001.
It would be good to generate (random) number at compile time.


* Flash ROM recover from shutdown


* Flash ROM garbage collection


* Flash ROM protection
